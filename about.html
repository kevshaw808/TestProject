    <h1>Kevin Shaw</h1>
    <p>Hi, thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Kevin Shaw
    and I am still getting started with learning how to make web pages. I thin
    it could either be a fun little side hobby, or maybe, one day I can become
    a web developer as an occupation. I really enjoy learning new things and 
    I am thrilled that I can take part in the Continuing College of Education
    to keep learning. </p>
